# Pizza Order üçï 

## By Liam Campbell

## Description

Pizza order greets users and asks them how many small and large pizzas they would like to order. The program then adds up the total number of pizzas that were ordered and calculates the total cost of the order. Finally the order is repeated back to the user and they are thanked for using the ordering system.
